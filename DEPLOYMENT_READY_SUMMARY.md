## 📋 **POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING**

### **Once deployed, test these endpoints:**

#### **1. Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/api/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "service": "Consolidata Building Code API"}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Analysis:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/api/enhanced-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "building_type": "office",
    "jurisdiction": "NBC",
    "occupancy_load": 150,
    "room_length": 12.0,
    "room_width": 8.0,
    "accessibility_level": "enhanced"
  }'
# Expected: Full compliance checklist and 2D layout
```

#### **3. Frontend Access:**
```bash

## 💰 **COST BREAKDOWN**

### **Railway Hosting (Recommended):**
- **Month 1**: Free (500 hours)
- **Month 2+**: $5/month
- **Annual**: $60/year

### **Total First Year:**
- **Development**: $500 (threading fix)
- **Hosting**: $55 (11 months × $5)
- **Domain** (optional): $12
- **Total**: **$567/year**

### **ROI Comparison:**
- **Your solution**: $567/year
- **PostgreSQL alternative**: $5,000-10,000/year
- **Savings**: $4,400-9,400! 🎉

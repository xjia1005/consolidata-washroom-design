   4. Organize by category (fixtures, clearances, accessibility)
   5. Create verification procedures for each item
📤 OUTPUT: Detailed compliance checklist (exportable)
```

### **WORKFLOW 3: Requirements → Layout Generation**
```
📥 INPUT: Requirements + space constraints
🔄 PROCESS:
   1. Select optimal function packages for requirements
   2. Calculate space allocation for each package
   3. Apply spatial layout algorithm with clearance rules
   4. Optimize for accessibility and circulation
   5. Verify layout meets all spatial requirements
   6. Generate alternative layouts if space permits
📤 OUTPUT: Optimized layout with coordinates and clearances
```

### **WORKFLOW 4: Layout → Compliance Verification**
```
📥 INPUT: Generated layout + requirements
🔄 PROCESS:
   1. Verify fixture counts match requirements
   2. Check all clearance requirements are met
   3. Validate accessibility compliance (routes, dimensions)
   4. Confirm code compliance for specific jurisdiction
   5. Calculate compliance scores and efficiency metrics
   6. Generate compliance report with pass/fail status
📤 OUTPUT: Compliance verification report
```
